- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anaita64Singh
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, deep learning, web development, competitive programming and basically everything about computer science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways in which I can utilise my passion for making this world a better place and my love for computer science and physics. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I always want to connect the different blocks of this world. I can say that I am quite hugely impacted by the poor and lesser privileged people that I see in my day to day life.Hence, no matter what I do, I am always looking forward to put it to some use for them .I am quite a multidisciplinary enthusiast, passionate about algorithms, fine maths and Arts(:-) both) , history,political science, geography, literature, quantum physics, deep learning , coding of all sorts, hardware and software(basically what not).
